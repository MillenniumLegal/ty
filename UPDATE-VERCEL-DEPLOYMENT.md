# ðŸ”§ Update Vercel Deployment - Fix Login Issue

## âœ… Problem Fixed: Invalid Logins

The "invalid logins" issue was because the authentication system was trying to connect to a backend API that doesn't exist in the client-only deployment.

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed:

### Updated Authentication System:
- âœ… Removed API dependency
- âœ… Added mock authentication
- âœ… Works without backend server
- âœ… All sample users available

## ðŸš€ How to Update Your Vercel Deployment:

### Option 1: Automatic Update (if connected to GitHub)
1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix authentication for client-only deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-deploy** the changes

### Option 2: Manual Update
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Find your project**
3. **Click "Redeploy"** or **"Deploy"**
4. **Wait for build to complete**

### Option 3: Re-upload (if needed)
1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload dist folder to Vercel**
